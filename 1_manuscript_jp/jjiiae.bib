abstract = {Many consumers consult online reviews before making (online) travel arrangements. Yet, little is known about the impact of these reviews on consumer decision making. This research applies consideration set theory to model the impact of online hotel reviews on consumer choice. An experimental study (N=168) that includes review valence (positive vs. negative reviews), hotel familiarity (well-known vs. lesser-known hotels), and reviewer expertise (expert vs. non-expert reviewers) as independent factors shows that on average, exposure to online reviews enhances hotel consideration in consumers. This is because positive as well as negative reviews increase consumer awareness of hotels, whereas positive reviews, in addition, improve attitudes toward hotels. These effects are stronger for lesser-known hotels. Reviewer expertise has only a minor – positive – influence on review impact.}

abstract = {A growing reliance on the Internet as an information source when making choices about tourism products raises the need for more research into electronic word of mouth. Within a hotel context, this study explores the role of four key factors that influence perceptions of trust and consumer choice. An experimental design is used to investigate four independent variables: the target of the review (core or interpersonal); overall valence of a set of reviews (positive or negative); framing of reviews (what comes first: negative or positive information); and whether or not a consumer generated numerical rating is provided together with the written text. Consumers seem to be more influenced by early negative information, especially when the overall set of reviews is negative. However, positively framed information together with numerical rating details increases both booking intentions and consumer trust. The results suggest that consumers tend to rely on easy-to-process information, when evaluating a hotel based upon reviews. Higher levels of trust are also evident when a positively framed set of reviews focused on interpersonal service.}

This study identifies the business value of consumer reviews and management responses to hotel performance. We present a panel data analysis of online consumer reviews and management responses of 843 hotels on a hotel review website. The results show that overall rating, attribute ratings of purchase value, location and cleanliness, variation and volume of consumer reviews, and the number of management responses are significantly associated with hotel performance. In addition, variation and volume of consumer reviews moderate the relationship between overall rating and hotel performance. Management responses, together with variation and volume of consumer reviews, moderate the relationship between certain attribute ratings and hotel performance. Implications of utilizing consumer reviews and management responses to leverage hotel business are provided.}

That is, if we were able to place a hotel with the same characteristics and services at two different destinations, would both have the same rating or would they differ? By using multilevel regression analysis, we have quantified the extent to which differences in client satisfaction with hotels can be attributed to the destination in which the hotels are located. We have measured this through ratings provided through social media outlets. Data downloaded from TripAdvisor from a sample of 7173 hotels were used. After controlling for specific variables, an 11.38% of the variance could be attributed to the destination. Thus, both hotels and destination management organizations (DMOs) are involved in client satisfaction and must work jointly to secure it.}

abstract = {This study reconfigures the user generated content in online hotel reviews to provide comparative and benchmarking insights about customer satisfaction. Hangzhou, an emerging tourism city in China, was selected for the study. Over a thousand user-generated reviews about four and five star hotels that were posted on Agoda.com were coded and analysed. Seventeen attributes influencing customer satisfaction were identified. The attributes were classified on the type of influence exerted: satisfiers (work in a solely positive direction), dissatisfiers (work in an exclusively negative direction), bidirectional forces (influence either positive or negative outcomes), and neutrals (no marked influence). The approach enabled the comparison of customer satisfaction between 4 and 5 star hotels, properties with different ownership, and the views of guests from different origins. The study suggests that a focused reclassification of the online review data can deliver powerful customer feedback messages for both researchers and hotel managers.}

abstract = {In this study, we present a novel method in generating summaries of multiple online reviews using a fine-grained sentiment extraction model for short texts, which is adaptable to different domains and languages. Adaptability of a model is defined as its ability to be easily modified and be usable on different domains and languages. This is important because of the diversity of domains and languages available. The fine-grained sentiment extraction model is divided into two methods: sentiment classification and aspect extraction. The sentiment classifier is built using a three-level classification approach, while the aspect extractor is built using extended biterm topic model (eBTM), an extension of LDA topic model for short texts. Overall, results show that the sentiment classifier outperforms baseline models and industry-standard classifiers while the aspect extractor outperforms other topic models in terms of aspect diversity and aspect extracting power. In addition, using the Naver movies dataset, we show that online review summarization can be effectively constructed using the proposed methods by comparing the results of our method and the results of a movie awards ceremony.}

In this paper, a novel method that combines the Bass/Norton model and sentiment analysis while using historical sales data and online review data is developed for product sales forecasting. A sentiment analysis method, the Naive Bayes algorithm, is used to extract the sentiment index from the content of each online review and integrate it into the imitation coefficient of the Bass/Norton model to improve the forecasting accuracy. We collected real-world automotive industry data and related online reviews. The computational results indicate that the combination of the Bass/Norton model and sentiment analysis has higher forecasting accuracy than the standard Bass/Norton model and some other sales forecasting models.}

abstract = {Online product reviews have significant impacts on consumers’ purchase decisions. To support consumers’ purchase decisions, how to rank the products through online reviews is a valuable research topic, while research concerning this issue is still relatively scarce. This paper proposes a method based on the sentiment analysis technique and the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory to rank the products through online reviews. An algorithm based on sentiment dictionaries is developed to identify the positive, neutral or negative sentiment orientation on the alternative product concerning the product feature in each review. According to the identified positive, neutral and negative sentiment orientations, an intuitionistic fuzzy number is constructed for representing the performance of an alternative product concerning a product feature. The ranking of alternative products is determined by intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator and preference ranking organization methods for enrichment evaluations II (PROMETHEE II). A case study is given to illustrate the use of the proposed method. The comparisons and experiments are further conducted to illustrate the characteristics and advantages of the proposed method. Converting the identified positive, neutral and negative sentiment orientations into intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is a new idea for processing and fusing a large number of sentiment orientations of online reviews. Based on the proposed method, decision support system can be developed to support the consumers’ purchase decisions more conveniently.}

abstract = { A statistical method reveals relationships among variables in complex data sets. Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships. }
